# What are microservices?
Created: 2021-08-07 07:31

A microservice only has the code for the specific type of thing it was built to do. It has its own database and will never share ressources with another microservice. If one of many microservices crashes the only thing that doesn't work is this specific part. 

It is easy to put new services onto it since it is just another microservice added to the group of microservices and doesn't have to be mangled into a huge codebase like a monolithic server.
